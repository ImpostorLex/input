**Task:**  
Fill in the `### Key Topics` section of the note by:

- **Linking only to headers with exactly `##`** (do not include bold text, `###`, or deeper subheadings).
    
- Always **include the note name in the link**.
    
    - Example: `[[Active Directory#Very Important Header|I am a much better explanation]]`
        
    - If you don’t know the note name, ask me.
        
- Provide a **short, descriptive explanation** of each section — ideally mentioning tools, techniques, methods, or key ideas to answer: _“What is this section about?”_
    
- **Skip empty sections** (if a header has no meaningful content under it, do not include it).
    
- **Do not use backticks** anywhere (so it’s Obsidian-friendly).
    
Also suggest a proper note name for the given note - ideally best what the readers will accomplish or anything that basically fits the whole note.

**Format Example:**

### Key Topics

- [[Active Directory#Built-in Tools|Use whois, traceroute to find out IP addresses and other details.]]
    
- [[Active Directory#Maltego|Map relationships and visualize data with Maltego’s transforms.]]
```
