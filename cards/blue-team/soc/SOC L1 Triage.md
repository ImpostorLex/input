- An **alert** is a specific event generated by a security solution.
- High > Medium > Low Alerts.
- **Prioritize oldest alerts and end with the newest one**, assuming there is two breaches, the older breach is already dumping your data, while the 'newcomer' has just started discovery.
- Triage is the process of analyzing, extracting, and processing information putting them into actionable activity.

### Triaging
---

- Assigned the alert to yourself, **familiarize yourself with the alert details**.
- Investigation:
	- Consult first if there is a **playbook** for this specific alert.
	- If not:
	1. Understand who is under threat, like the affected user, hostname, cloud, network, or website
	2. Note the action described in the alert, like whether it was a suspicious login, malware, or phishing
	3. Review surrounding events, **looking for suspicious actions shortly after or before the alert**
	4. Use threat intelligence platforms or other available resources to verify your thoughts.
