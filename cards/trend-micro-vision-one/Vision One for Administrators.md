XDR capabilities:

- Correlated detection
- In-depth investigation
- Built-in response actions
- Search capability of telemetry and MITRE tactics and techniques
- Automatic sweeping for Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
- Integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms

Vision One capabilities:

- **Collects telemetry:** Sensors on the endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, network, and email accounts, collect raw activity telemetry and forward to the Trend Micro Data Lake for storage and analysis.
- **Correlates events:** Filters correlate events within the activity data in the data lake using a variety of techniques including data stacking, machine learning and expert rules.
- **Detects attack behaviors:** Detection models written by Trend Micro threat experts combine these filters to identify attack behaviors. These automated and cross-layer detection models tie together low-level events to find stealthy attackers. Detection models are frequently updated/added by Trend Micro.
- **Investigate events:** Detection model alerts are investigated and responded to by either your own internal SOC or by Trend Micro analysts (when subscribed to the Trend Micro Managed XDR service).
