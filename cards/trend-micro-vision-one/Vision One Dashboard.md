## Vision One Dashboard

Operations Dashboard provides analysts with the information needed to quickly assess cloud access activities and vulnerabilities related to users and devices, and determine how to mitigate the risks found in the network.

In the Trend Micro Vision One console, click the **Operations Dashboard** app and click the **Risk Factors** tab. Trend Micro Vision One displays the **Risk Index** score for your environment

The **Risk Factors** tab also displays a list of **At-risk Users and Devices**. These are the users or devices that are currently displaying a risk score of at least 70

The **Risk Index** value displayed for your organization uses data collected over the last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days and identifies the specific risk factors that contribute to the score.

Resolving high risk events on these users and devices helps mitigate the overall risk to the organization and contributes to the risk index assessment by the **Operations Dashboard** app.

Click the user or device name in the **At-risk Users/Devices** section of the **Risk Factors**Â tab to view the details of the risk events, the associated risk factors detected, and what mitigation actions are suggested for each event.
