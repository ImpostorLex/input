### Introduction 
---
Penetration testing is the act of finding vulnerabilities in a given system such as software or how high-value employees are admitted to a confidential room. However the penetration agreement is just as important discovering vulnerabilities in a system, a bad agreement could lead to many things such as the penetration tester being sued by performing out of scope activities, production is affected leading to data loss or worse crippling the organization to perform their business operation.
## Rules of Behavior
It is the outline of the penetration test, including: the framework for external and internal penetration testing, most importantly is the common ground between the penetration tester and the company to establish what are the limitations, potential impact on business operation, and the action to take on unplanned events.

Both parties should have a representative that will sign the agreement form including a "Get out of jail" card that the penetration testers will be held harmless for unintentional interruptions and any type of damages that may occur during the test.

**The Main Ingredients**
- The scope of the penetration test and the risk involved.
- What or who are the targets.
- Time frame.
- Rules.
- Authorization to proceed with the penetration test.

**The limitations**
Pentesting requires time and money which could become an issue depending on what has been agreed upon during the rules of behavior such as penetration testing hundreds of machines in the span of one week: without knowing what types of attacks are off-limit could lead to issues.

The most important thing is to establish the following during the agreement:
- **Criteria of Success** or specific goals.
	- Access to Internal Resources.
	- Reading Restricted Files.
	- Accessing high privileged accounts.
	- .....
- **Penetration test approach** - depending on the environment the penetration should consider what are the approach or techniques to be used on a given environment.
	- **Zero Knowledge** the tester have no idea what are they attacking and must start at information gathering.
	- **Partial Knowledge** information that a real world motivated threat actor could find.
	- **Full Knowledge** simulates a type of attack where the attacker knows the environment of the organization, documentation, employees and more.

**Rules of Behavior**
- Includes describing testing techniques for internal and external testing and it should be comprehensive to avoid inadvertent damage or miscommunication.
- Key representative or the main point of contact includes name and role.
	- Alternative point of contact.
	- Should be aware of the testing scope and any relevant details about the penetration project.
	- Is the person notified in case there is a unplanned security incident during the course of the penetration test or alarms that is not part of the scope triggered accidentally.
